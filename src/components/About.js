				<h1>Marvel Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media
					franchise and shared universe centered on a series of
					superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are
					based on characters that appear in American comic books
					published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes
					television series, short films, digital series, and
					literature. The shared universe, much like the original
					Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing
					over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.
